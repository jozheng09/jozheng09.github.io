                    Newspark is a news platform that aims to bridge the gap between social media and news content. <br>Currently, 
                    young people gain most of their news content from social media rather than trusted news outlets. 
                    Consequently, many users consume media content that lacks credibility and accuracy.<br> 
                    <br>
                    In order to encourage young users to be more aware of fact-checking 
                    and employing critical thinking when consuming media content while appealing to our audience, 
                    we integrated elements from social media 
                    (creating profiles, discussion threads, following and engaging with other accounts), 
                    and news outlets (fact-checking, implementing verification statuses, 
                    adding details about political figures and sources). <br>
                    <br>
                    While our interface has similar elements 
                    to other news platforms, we integrated unique elements that cater to our audience 
                    including a toggle button that displays only fact-checked articles, 
                    and a ranking system that encourages users to engage in discussion and stay updated with news.</p1>
