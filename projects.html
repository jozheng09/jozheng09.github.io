                    <br>
                    Newspark is a news platform that aims to bridge the gap between social media and news content. <br>Currently, 
                    young people gain most of their news content from social media rather than trusted news outlets. 
                    Consequently, many users consume media content that lacks credibility and accuracy.<br> 
                    <br>
                    In order to encourage young users to be more aware of fact-checking 
                    and employing critical thinking when consuming media content while appealing to our audience, 
                    we integrated elements from social media 
                    (creating profiles, discussion threads, following and engaging with other accounts), 
                    and news outlets (fact-checking, implementing verification statuses, 
                    adding details about political figures and sources). <br>
                    <br>
                    While our interface has similar elements 
                    to other news platforms, we integrated unique elements that cater to our audience 
                    including a toggle button that displays only fact-checked articles, 
                    and a ranking system that encourages users to engage in discussion and stay updated with news.</p1>

                    <br>
                    Through our application, we wanted to brainstorm what topics we wanted to address <br>
                    and figure out our priorities for Newspark. <br>
                    The top questions to address were: <br>
                    <br>
                        <b>"How to engage a younger audience?"</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                <p1 class = "subtext2"><b>Research</b><br>
                    There were a couple of main points we discovered during research.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Selective Exposure</b>
                    <br>
                    "Audiences can nowadays actively seek out or avoid political information <br>based on their political priors."
                    <br>
                    "Although selection processes may not always operate consciously, <br>
                    the selection of reinforcing rather than challenging views fulfills the need to maintain a consistent image of the self (Festinger, 1957). <br>
                    The desire to avoid cognitive dissonance can result in a confirmation bias, <br>meaning that audiences only select information congruent with their prior attitudes"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Misinformation is still hard to correct or identify</b><br>
                    "Even after clear retractions, misinformation primarily continues to influence and persuade peopleâ€™s attitudes when it is tightly intertwined <br>
                    with strongly held partisan beliefs or ideology (Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Taber & Lodge, 2006; Thorson, 2016)."
