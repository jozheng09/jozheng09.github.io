                I am a third-year student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computational Media with a focus on Interaction Design and People.<br>
                  I really enjoy learning new aspects about design and art in technology and hope to go into UI/UX in the future!
                  <br>In my free time, I enjoy creating illustrations, running my small Etsy shop, streaming, and playing with my cat :)</p1>
